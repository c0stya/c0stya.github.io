    "text": "My name is Konstantin Selivanov. I am a machine learning engineer and researcher.\nMy focus is representation learning and sequence modeling using deep learning methods. I am good at implementing papers and optimizing the ml algorithms. All the startups where I worked as first ml engineer were profitably sold. Some were backed by Google Ventures and Sequoia by more than $100 millions. I lead ml teams. Sometimes I do consulting. Feel free to reach out to me.\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/selivanov/\nGithub: https://github.com/c0stya"

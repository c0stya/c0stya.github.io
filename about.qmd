My name is **Konstantin Selivanov**. I am a machine learning engineer and researcher.

- **LinkedIn**: [Konstantin Selivanov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/selivanov/)
- **GitHub**: [c0stya](https://github.com/c0stya)

My lifelong focus has been on **representation learning** and **deep learning**. I enjoy at implementing research papers and optimizing machine learning algorithms. As the first machine learning engineer at several startups, I contributed to their successful exits, with some backed by **Google Ventures** and **Sequoia Capital** for over \$100 million. Feel free to reach out to me.

## Interests

- **Representation Learning**: embeddings, contrastive learning, and information retrieval.
- **Natural Language Processing**: large language models (LLMs).
- **Generative Models**: autoencoders, normalizing flows, and diffusion models.
- **Sequential Models**: rnns, transformers, state-space models.

I value **minimalism** and **efficiency**. My primary programming languages are **Python**, **C**, and **Shell**. I have been a **Linux** user for over 20 years. I am passionate about **mathematics** and **philosophy**.

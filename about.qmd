My name is **Konstantin Selivanov**. I am a machine learning engineer and researcher.

- **LinkedIn**: [Konstantin Selivanov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/selivanov/)
- **GitHub**: [c0stya](https://github.com/c0stya)

My lifelong focus has been on **representation learning** and **deep learning**. I excel at implementing research papers and optimizing machine learning algorithms. As the first machine learning engineer at several startups, I contributed to their successful exits, with some backed by **Google Ventures** and **Sequoia Capital** for over \$100 million. I have experience leading machine learning teams and occasionally offer consulting services. Feel free to reach out to me.

## Interests

- **Representation Learning**: Embeddings, contrastive learning, and information retrieval.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Large language models (LLMs).
- **Generative Models**: Autoencoders, normalizing flows, and diffusion models.
- **Sequential Models**: RNNs, transformers, Mamba, and RWKV.

### Other Topics in Machine Learning and Computer Science

- Reinforcement learning and game theory.
- Formal languages, compilers, and automata theory.
- Logic and formal proofs (Coq, Metamath).
- Low-level programming in C/CUDA.

I value **minimalism** and **efficiency**. My primary programming languages are **Python**, **C**, and **Shell**. I have been a **Linux** user for over 20 years. I am passionate about **mathematics** and **philosophy**.
